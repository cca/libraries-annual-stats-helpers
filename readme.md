# Libraries' Annual Statistics Helper Scripts

These are all client-side JavaScript tools for summing data in Koha annual statistics reports. Basically, they do some of the tedious work of combining our administrative item types into types that are more understandable for others, which then lets us post informative tables of data onto [the Library Data page](https://libraries.cca.edu/about-us/about-us/library-data/).

They are all meant to be run in your browser's JavaScript console; open it up with <kbd>CMD + Option + J</kbd> on a Mac using Chrome. Then copy-paste the code of the appropriate script into the console and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>. The output is usually copied to your keyboard in a tabular format but for some of the scripts it may be printed into the JS console, where you can manually transfer it to the appropriate spreadsheet.
